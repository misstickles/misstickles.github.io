Overall, until approximately 2007, mean ratings were steady around 5.8 / 6.0.  After 2007, people started rating their games higher.  The 2020 COVID-19 pandemic did not appear to change this trend.  People seemed to be able to enjoy their board games in the middle of World War 2 too.

**1957** has an 'unusual' drop in mean board game ratings.  At 3.93, it is 1.91 lower than 1956, 1.7 lower than 1958 and is the lowest rating in over 100 years.  [Some interesting things happeded](https://www.thepeoplehistory.com/1957.html) in 1957 - notably the first 'Frisbee' became available and there was a Flu pandemic in Asia.
